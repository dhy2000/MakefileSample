# MakefileSample

A sample makefile for simple c and c++ project(only 1 executable target)

It compiles project with `-std=c99` for C source and `-std=c++11` for C++ source, with debug option `-g` on and a macro `_DEBUG` for conditional compilation(e.g. print debug message).

You can modify them if needed.
